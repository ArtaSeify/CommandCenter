Attack in batches
When a unit dies, leaving time for only one search is gives build orders which are far worse than what were found before
attacking slows down the game
smarter micromanagement. get the unit to attack the closest unit it is strong against. eg: immortal attack stalker not zealot
warpgate chronoboost inside commandcenter doesnt work
BOSS crashes with invalid chronoboost target
WarpGate research doesn't work properly. it is added as an action even though its being researched
adjust build order to opponent
	continuously scout opponent so we can adjust better?
